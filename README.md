## Acknowledgments

This project, including aspects of its design, code structure, and textual content, was developed with the assistance of Google's Gemini Advanced Pro 2.5 (May 2025), a large language model.  
Interactions with Gemini helped in generating boilerplate HTML/CSS, refining JavaScript logic, debugging code and ideating on design elements. 
All final content and code were reviewed and curated by me, Sonja Heinze.
